### About flexdashboard

Flexdashboard is a library that takes R Markdown documents and turns them into a website. You can build up different website layout elements like pages, panels, rows, and columns. In each part of your website, you can use a blend of text/image content and R code, just like in normal R Markdown documents. A flexdashboard document can be compiled (or "knit") to an HTML file that can then be shared as a file or published as a website.
