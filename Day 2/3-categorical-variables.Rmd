## Load packages

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(colorspace)
library(readxl)
library(here)
here::i_am("Day 2/3-categorical-variables.Rmd")

```

## Load your data

```{r}

# We're going to load this dataset in a different way this time. We're going to
# leave some of the factors out of it so we can practice making them ourselves.

inclusiveness_index_unfactored <- 
  read_excel(here("data", "inclusiveness_index", "global_data_for_website_2020.xlsx"),
             na="9999") %>%
  rename_with(~ str_remove_all(.x, "[(|)]") %>% str_replace_all("[-| ]", ".")) %>%
  dplyr::filter(Continent != "Antarctica") 

```

## Add factors based on data meaning (natural ordering)

```{r}

# The Index.categories.2020 variable is a categorical variable with a natural
# ordering: High to Low (or High to No data). 

# See what a plot looks like when we just use the data without creating a factor.

ggplot(data = inclusiveness_index_unfactored) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Continent,
                         fill = Index.categories.2020)) +
  scale_fill_discrete_sequential(palette = "Purple-Blue")

```

```{r}
# To ensure the variable is always displayed with the correct order, first determine 
# the order by looking at the possible values. Then create a vector with the 
# correct order and use that vector to set new levels for the factor.

unique(inclusiveness_index_unfactored$Index.categories.2020)

index_cat_levels <- c(___________)

inclusiveness_index_factored_natural <- inclusiveness_index_unfactored %>% 
  mutate(Index.categories.2020 = Index.categories.2020 %>% as_factor() %>% 
           fct_relevel(___________))

```

```{r}

# And here is exactly the same chart again, just using the modified dataset.

ggplot(data = ____________) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Continent,
                         fill = Index.categories.2020)) +
  scale_fill_discrete_sequential(palette = "Purple-Blue")


```

## Add factors based on data patterns

```{r}

# Let's look again at this bar chart showing average inclusiveness index by
# continent. What do you think about the order of the bars?

inclusiveness_index_factored_natural %>% 
  drop_na(Inclusiveness.index.2020) %>%
  group_by(Continent) %>% 
  summarise(avg_inclusiveness = mean(Inclusiveness.index.2020)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Continent, y = avg_inclusiveness)) +
  geom_col()

```

```{r}

# For a chart like this, ordering the bars by highest to lowest can make it easier
# to see the patterns in the data. For this kind of factor, though, we don't
# necessarily want to make a permanent change to the dataset. The order of the 
# continents that makes sense for this chart may not make sense for other views
# of the data.

# In cases like these, we can create a factor as part of the data processing
# and then pipe it right into the chart, instead of storing that factor as
# part of the data frame.

inclusiveness_index_factored_natural %>% 
  drop_na(Inclusiveness.index.2020) %>%
  group_by(Continent) %>% 
  summarise(avg_inclusiveness = mean(Inclusiveness.index.2020)) %>%
  mutate(Continent = Continent %>% as_factor() %>% ________________) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Continent, y = avg_inclusiveness)) +
  geom_col()

```

## Rotating a plot with long names

```{r}

# This plot shows the inclusiveness index for European countries,
# without the null values. But you'll have to take my word for it!

inclusiveness_index_factored_natural %>% 
  drop_na(Inclusiveness.index.2020) %>%
  dplyr::filter(Continent == "Europe") %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Country, y = Inclusiveness.index.2020)) +
  geom_col()

```

```{r}

# Let's go ahead and flip the axes so we can see the labels.

inclusiveness_index_factored_natural %>% 
  drop_na(Inclusiveness.index.2020) %>%
  dplyr::filter(Continent == "Europe") %>%
  ggplot...

```


```{r}

# Now we can also sort the bars based on the inclusiveness index by 
# creating a factor on Country. Remember, the axes "start" from the
# bottom left-hand corner, so what would normally be on the left on the
# x axis will be on the bottom on the y axis.


inclusiveness_index_factored_natural %>% 
  drop_na(Inclusiveness.index.2020) %>%
  dplyr::filter(Continent == "Europe") %>%
  mutate(____________) %>%
  ggplot...

```

## Additional charts for categorical data

### Pie Chart

```{r}

# A pie chart works a lot like a bar chart. It takes one categorical variable
# and one number. But ggplot2 struggles a bit to visualize pie charts because
# they don't operate on a normal x-y coordinate plane.

# The first stage of a pie chart is actually a stacked bar chart with one bar.
# Here we've used the y aesthetic, so the bar is horizontal. We don't actually
# have to specify a variable for y, though, because we don't want multiple bars
# along the y axis. We just want one. So we can give it a single value, like
# "".

# Then we fill the bar with the variable we want to use for our different
# pie wedges. Here we're using index categories.

inclusiveness_index_factored_natural %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = "", fill = Index.categories.2020)) +
    geom_bar(position=position_fill(), color="#cccccc") +
    scale_fill_discrete_sequential(palette = "Purple-Blue")


```

```{r}

# The final step in the pie chart is to change the coordinate system. The default
# coordinate system for a bar chart is Cartesian. We can use a coord_polar() layer
# to change this to a polar coordinate system, which starts at the "12:00" position
# and rotaties one way or the other. We specify "direction = -1" to have it rotate
# counter-clockwise, putting the dark blue color on the left and the gray color
# on the right. This is just personal preference - I like the largest wedge on the
# right.

# At this point, you can adjust the theme of the plot to get it to look better, but
# ggplot2 doesn't have great support for making pie charts look nice.

inclusiveness_index_factored_natural %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = "", fill = Index.categories.2020)) +
    geom_bar(position=position_fill(), color="#cccccc") +
    coord_polar(direction = -1) +
    scale_fill_discrete_sequential(palette = "Purple-Blue")

```


### Heat Map

```{r}

# When you have two categorical variables you want to show in the same plot,
# you can add color to a bar chart, but that's not always the most effective
# way to explore the data. For example, stacked bars make it easy to compare
# the bar segments on the bottom and the overall heights of the bars, but the
# values in the middle are very different to compare. 

# One alternative to stacked bars is a heat map, or a table where you place
# each categorical variable on one axis, and then the cell at the intersection
# of those categories is colored to show a numerical value. Take the example
# below, where we are splitting the data up into continents and index categories
# and then using color to show how many data points there are in each bin.

inclusiveness_index_factored_natural %>% 
    count(Continent, Index.categories.2020) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Continent, y = Index.categories.2020, fill = n)) +
    geom_tile() 

```

```{r}

# Another reason heat maps may be more effective is if the data you are trying
# to show includes both postivie and negative numbers, or numbers that shouldn't
# be added together. Stacked bar charts strongly suggest that the sum of the
# numbers in the bar is meaningful, that it's important to know the total. That
# isn't true for the dataset below, where we have calculated the average
# inclusiveness index and other sub-indices for the various continents. Not only
# are there negative values in this dataset, but it is not meaningful to add
# up the averages of the different indices. 

# This heat map breaks down the data so we can see on average how the countries
# in each continent compare on the different sub-indices, as well as the overall
# inclusiveness index.

inclusiveness_index_factored_natural %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Inclusiveness.index.2020, starts_with("Z")), 
               names_to = "index_name",
               values_to = "index_values",
               values_drop_na = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(Continent, index_name) %>%
  summarise(mean_incl_ind = mean(index_values), .groups="drop") %>%
  mutate(index_name = index_name %>%
           as_factor() %>%
           fct_reorder(mean_incl_ind),
         Continent = Continent %>%
           as_factor() %>%
           fct_reorder(mean_incl_ind) %>%
           fct_rev()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = index_name, x = Continent, fill = mean_incl_ind)) +
    geom_tile() +
    scale_fill_distiller(type="div", palette = 3, 
                         limits=c(-.8,.8), 
                         direction = -1)

```

### Dumbbell plot

```{r}

# Another limitation of bar charts is when you want to make direct numerical
# comparisons across series. The heatmap can show two continents next to each
# other, but it's hard to directly compare shades of colors to see data patterns.
# On the other hand, even side by side bar charts can make it hard to see these
# patterns. 

# Imagine we want to compare Asia and Europe in terms of the number of
# countries in each index category.

# The first plot groups all of the segments by continent, which makes it easy 
# to compare different Index categories within a single continent. This plot
# shows a version of a bar chart we haven't talked about - a grouped bar chart,
# which you create in ggplot2 with "position = position_dodge()".


ggplot(
  inclusiveness_index_factored_natural %>% 
    dplyr::filter(Continent %in% c("Asia", "Europe")),
  mapping = aes(x = Continent, fill = Index.categories.2020)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge()) +
  scale_fill_discrete_sequential(palette = "Purple-Blue")

```

```{r}
# What if we want to bring more attention to the difference between continents for 
# each category? We could always switch which category is the primary division on 
# the x axis and which is represented by color.

ggplot(
  inclusiveness_index_factored_natural %>% 
    dplyr::filter(Continent %in% c("Asia", "Europe")),
  mapping = aes(fill = Continent, x = Index.categories.2020)) +
  geom_bar(position = position_dodge())

```

```{r}
# This improves our ability to compare the continents directly because the bars 
# are directly next to each other. The amount of space the bars take up is still 
# pretty large, though. If we combine this chart with something like a scatter plot, 
# we get one last variation: a dumbbell plot,

# With a dumbbell plot, we use a circle to represent the data values, just like 
# the lollipop. Instead of having a line that extends all the way to the axis, 
# though, we use a line to connect the two dots in each category of Inclusiveness 
# Index.

ggplot(
  inclusiveness_index_factored_natural %>% 
    dplyr::filter(Continent %in% c("Asia", "Europe")) %>%
    count(Continent, Index.categories.2020),
  mapping = aes(x = Index.categories.2020, y=n)) +
  geom_line(aes(group=Index.categories.2020), color="#555555", linewidth=1) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Continent), size=6)
