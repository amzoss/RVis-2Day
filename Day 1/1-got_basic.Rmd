## Setup your environment

```{r}

# Load required libraries

library(tidyverse)

```

## Load your data

```{r}

# data comes from https://int.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/2017-07-17-got-matrix/mean.json
# data based on ratings using tool at https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/09/upshot/game-of-thrones-chart.html

got <- read_csv("data/got_ratings.csv")

```

## Create a basic plot

```{r}

# a plot should include:
# - a call to ggplot()
# - a dataset
# - a call to aes(), including the main x and y variables
# - a geom layer that specifies the type of chart or shape


```

## Set the size of all points to 5

```{r}

# hint: check ?geom_point to see the different aesthetics options available, but think carefully
# about where the new option should go in the function


```

## Set the color of all points to "firebrick"

```{r}


```

## Set the alpha (transparency) of all points to .75

```{r}


```

## Add a main title

```{r}

# check https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ for likely layers


```

## Advanced: add a trend line, preferably a simple linear trend line

```{r}

# hint: look at the options for geom_smooth


```
