## Setup your environment

```{r}

# Load required libraries

library(tidyverse)

```

## Load your data

```{r}

# built-in data

starwars_chars <- starwars

```

## Create a plot to explore the height of Star Wars characters

```{r}

# hint: height is numerical; 
# look for geoms that do a good job of summarizing numerical variables



```

## Facets: Add a facet to the chart to create small multiples for each gender

```{r}

# hint: try facet_wrap



```

## Create a new plot to compare character heights to weights (masses)

```{r}

# what geom is best for two numerical variables?



```

## Data inheritance: Add a label to (only) the heaviest character

```{r}

# hint: you can use "data=" in a geom layer to use different data for that layer 



```

## Advanced: Add a linear trend line

```{r}

# hint: look at the options for geom_smooth



```
