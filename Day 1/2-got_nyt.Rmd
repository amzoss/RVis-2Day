## Setup your environment

```{r}

# Load required libraries

library(tidyverse)

```

## Load your data

```{r}

# data comes from https://int.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2017/2017-07-17-got-matrix/mean.json
# data based on ratings using tool at https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/09/upshot/game-of-thrones-chart.html

got <- read_csv("data/got_ratings.csv")

```

## Plot the data

```{r}

# add a geom and an aes() function with the correct x and y variables



```

## Add labels

```{r}

# hint: check https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layer-geoms for all geom options



```

## Fix label overlap

```{r}

# hint: look at ?geom_text for a property that might change the position slightly
# once you've found something to try, be careful: are you adding a new variable, or is it a constant change?



```

## Add colors

```{r}

# add gender as a color three different ways:
# - points only
# - labels only
# - both



```

## Turn off legend for text layer

```{r}

# hint: there is another property for the geom_text layer that might help



```


## Switch direction of Y axis

```{r}

# hint: edits to axes often use scales
# check https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-scales for pre-built scales 
# that might help (focus on scales for the y-axis)



```

## Add reference lines

```{r}

# hint: there are special geoms for straight lines;
# check https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layer-geoms for all geom options



```

```{r}

# look at how ggplot2 is layering the plot; rearrange layers as needed



```

## Change the theme

```{r}

# Try to find a theme closer to the NYT chart;
# see https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-themes for built-in themes



```

## Change axis limits

```{r}

# the chart might look better if the axes go all the way from 0 to 1; edit
# the axes to force them to include 0 and 1
# hint: remember that changes to axes usually involve a scale



```

## Annotate the axes with descriptive text

```{r}

# hint: geoms are typically best for chart elements involving data;
# look for another feature that can add text to charts
# https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/



```
