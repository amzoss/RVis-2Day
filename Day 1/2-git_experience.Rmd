## Setup your environment

```{r}

# Load required libraries

library(tidyverse)

```

## Load your data

```{r}

# load using included script file

source('data/git_experience/load_git_experience.R')

```

## Plot the responses to "Which version control system did you start out using?"

```{r}

# use the variable called "first_vcs"

# hint: there is a geom that will take a single discrete variable and count the data points in
# each category


```

## Reproduce the same plot using the "count" function and a different geom

```{r}


```

## Take either plot and use factors to reorganize the categories

```{r}

# update the dataset so that the categorical variable is treated
# as a factor, and the order of the factor levels corresponds
# to their frequency in some way


```

## Advanced: Use a different color for each opinion level

```{r}


```

## Advanced: Add "regularly_teach" as a fill color to the bars

```{r}


```

## Talk it out: what are the general steps you would take to make this chart?

![A bar chart with "first_vcs" on the x axis, "mean_proficiency" on the y axis, and the bars sorted in descending order.](images/mean_proficiency.png)

## Plot the responses to "When did you first start using a version control system?"

```{r}

# use the variable called "year_vcs" and geom_line()
# what needs to happen to the data for geom_line to work?
# Hint: try geom_bar() first if you're not sure how to get started



```

## Create another line chart of year_vcs that has separate lines (in separate colors) for each category in first_vcs

```{r}

# Hint: you still need to process the data for this chart, but it will
# look a bit different. Think about what data you need for each line and
# how that data could all appear in the same table.



```

## Use alternative geoms to plot "first_vcs" by "year_vcs"

```{r}

# Plot "year_vcs" on the x axis and "first_vcs" on the y axis
# Try out the following geoms, adjusting the data as needed
# - geom_count()
# - geom_point() --> hint: make this look like geom_count by adding a new aes()
# - geom_jitter()
# - geom_tile() --> hint: this is designed to use fill, thought it's not required



```
