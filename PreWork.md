# Pre-Work for Visualization for Data Science in R

Welcome to "Visualization in Data Science using R," a two-day course on using R for visualization. The basic prerequisites and requirements for the course are as follows:

"This course assumes basic familiarity with R -- e.g., R syntax, data structures, development environments. Visualizations will be created with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and other [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) libraries, but prior experience with those libraries is not required. In order to fully participate in class exercises, participants install the following on their laptops: current versions of [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), the tidyverse package, and the knitr package (optional)."

## Installations

Here is a more complete list of the packages you'll want to install in RStudio:

* tidyverse
* plotly
* flexdashboard
* shiny

(Note: Mac users without Xcode already installed may see a prompt to install Xcode or the "command line tools" to compile some packages from source. You should go ahead and do that -- at least the command line tools. This is often a large installation, though, so it may take a bit of time.)


## Course Logistics

I will be sharing datasets and code using [GitHub](https://github.com/), but you will not have to have a GitHub account or a git installation on your laptop to participate in the course. It will be easy to download the files from the GitHub website and open them in RStudio.

For this course I will be using [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files rather than simple R scripts. RMarkdown is a way of interweaving R code with other kinds of descriptive content -- text, links, images. When you only use R scripts in RStudio, the plots show up in the plot window, which only shows one plot at a time. RMarkdown allows us to create separate code "chunks" for different plots, and each plot will appear immediately below its code chunk. If you're not familiar with RMarkdown, I will give a brief overview, but you can also [explore it on your own](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) in advance.
